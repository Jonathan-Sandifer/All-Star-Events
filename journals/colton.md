Today, I worked on:

*searched for apis that we can use to pull events from.

Our team broke up into individuals and each looked for apis that we could use. We originally tried EventBrite and others but they pulled down the api we needed. Contacted AllEvents to request their api as a substitute. Looked into Google Events Results API.
