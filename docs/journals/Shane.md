Today I worked on: 
Working with my team to find the 3rd party apis needed in order to integrate with our application to make sure we can build it as we envisioned. 

The process of finding working apis for events was very difficult. Curtis provided this link https://www.programmableweb.com/ which helped in searches but we eventually got the seatgeek api working to show us concert, broadway, comedy, and sporting event info. We were able to get a government national parks api working. 

I was able to find a trailforks api which looks like it has all the data we need for everything trails related. I reached out to the team to get access to the api, fingers crossed over the weekend they respond, because I was unable to find any other alternatives .
