* Today i saw the feedback from Curtis about our Readme not being legible enough so i altered it this morning.
* Afterwards, I then helped direct the group to get a consensus on what to do for the day, with the main issue being that
the apis' we wanted was shut down in 2020. With that damper in our plans we went on to     
* First, make sure the other apis' we needed worked
* Second, figure out how to find apis' that worked. The only api that we knew worked was our weather and our first api to refind wa our events.
* We spent a long time trying to figure out what would worked, so we asked for help, and eventually we got help from curtis. Colton then found
our next api, and we figured that with the apis we had, we did not need to search for a trails api, as Coltons api provided something like it.
* We ended the day making plans to go over the rest of our apis' and data models that we need to reconfigure.

* Worked with the group to visualize whether we would require our app to be a monolithic service or a microservice centric app, we decided on the microservice centric app as we aren't saving much if any data to warrant making it monolithic, dealt with some git issues, still havent fixed others.

* Was working on the project, made a logout page, looking at the work my companions made, talking over, some issues we were still having with git, in that there were some strange files coming from the database/data file,that was shutting down the database in the docker desktop container, that we enlisted the help of Curtis and with Shawn overlooking, we were
able to fix the problem(I hope).

* Finally finished off the Logout page, struggled with the CSS for this page longer than I thought I would. But it looks good, could possibly be made to look better.
* Started on working on the user centric events and parks page, wont be tied to the user yet as we havent learned how to do that yet...
* Its been a real stickler for the project but I know as soon as we get something working the progress for the app will go even faster on our backend

* Today I had some spare time to work on the project. So taking a look at the work I did for the Users events/parks page I noticed I didn't have a picture for that,
and a funny thing happened, I realized that while Colton had put in the pictures that we have been using, I didn't know how to do it myself. 
* I quickly learned that it was just a simple drag and drop from the where the file is located to the location I needed it to be in easy peasy.
* I am also making a note, that the data for that page will be displayed as cards either horizontal or vertically, but we need to do some work on the
backend before I can fully see this page realized.

## 6/10/2022
* Ouch it seems I have forgotton to update my journal entries for a few days, 
I have been working with the rest of my teammates to get a better understanding of how our backend will
be structured and a bunch of paired programming with the guys to make sure I understand how to make it all work for the portion I have to do. 
I have had a few hiccups though like 
this past week, being unable to really code effectively as I had technical issues with my internet stopping me from working on anything for about a day, and any extra work I could have been doing after the day was over for the cohort, but today I am back at it and will need to catch up.

## 6/24/2022
* Today is the last day and im going to fit the last two weeks into today, for starters, I unfortunately got sick a few days after I lost power so just whammies on whammies.
* This of course impeded my functionality to the team, but I did my best. Pair programming with my teammates when we came to difficult peices of our code, like the saving of events to a seperate page, or the access to the events api so that we can actually get events when we click go on our front page. And myself and Colton took the ownership of the css for the project so making sure it looks pretty and that any data that we are trying to convey to any potential users, is conveyed. Making sure that I add anything that the team needed to make other things work, like the Save button on the event cards that we wanted users to be able to choose what they want to save. And then towards the end helping
with the formatting of the project and making sure that our code looks clean. And then staying with Keiran to make sure that our project was deployed to heroku.
* I really appreciate all the work that myself and my teammates have put into this project even with all the obstacles that was being thrown our way, to make
a project that I am supremely proud of.
