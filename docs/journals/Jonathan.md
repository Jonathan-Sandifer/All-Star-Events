* Today i saw the feedback from Curtis about our Readme not being legible enough so i altered it this morning.
Afterwards, I then helped direct the group to get a consensus on what to do for the day, with the main issue being that
the apis' we wanted was shut down in 2020. With that damper in our plans we went on to, First, make sure the other apis' we needed worked
Second, figure out how to find apis' that worked. The only api that we knew worked was our weather and our first api to refind wa our events.
We spent a long time trying to figure out what would worked, so we asked for help, and eventually we got help from curtis. Colton then found
our next api, and we figured that with the apis we had, we did not need to search for a trails api, as Coltons api provided something like it.
We eneded the day making plans to go over the rest of our apis' and data models that we need to reconfigure.
