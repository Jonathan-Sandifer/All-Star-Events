Today, I worked on:

*searched for apis that we can use to pull events from.

Our team broke up into individuals and each looked for apis that we could use. We originally tried EventBrite and others but they pulled down the api we needed. Contacted AllEvents to request their api as a substitute. Looked into Google Events Results API.

I found a National Parks API that can do everything we need for our parks section. We worked together to break down different queries to find out what we could do to change our search preferences.

Today, I worked on:

Building a couple models in the parks_rest directory and used the National Parks API in Insomnia to find the different information I can pull.

Found it pretty easy to navigate the information listed by the National Parks.

Today did not go well.

We spent a lot of time as a group trying to get through git issues. I managed to put together basics for a main page in our app page. Most of the day was spent trying to get through blockers around git.

Today, I worked on:

I spent the better part of the day trying to use a template for react but I was unable to yield any results. It was difficult for me to use portions of someone's code because the languages would never match up the way I wanted. I ended up adding some color and of non-working search box for a city on the main page.

I learned how to use some CSS but I still need to learn how to make our background a picture for the main page.

## 6/3/22

Today I spent most of my time working on the main page and the footer. We now have a photo in the background of our main page and a footer on every page. Wondering how things are going to break when we bring in bootstrap...

Ready for the weekend after a long short week.

## 6/7/22

Today I fixed the homepage to make it sit higher on the page, I also built an EventsParks page. I only have dummy data hard coded in for now but I spent time learning about pulling data from APIs. I want to have it so when we enter a city in the search bar on the mainpage and search it, we are redirected to the EventsParks page with data for the corresponding city from the search.

I want to get the search bar to redirect me to the EventsParks page then I will work on pulling in the API data.

## 6/8/22

Today we worked as a team to get our APIs to work for our events and our geolocator. It felt good to make some progress today. I also made a button on the home page that redirects you to the eventsparks page. 

Overall we got a good amount done today.

## 6/9/22

Today we worked as a team pair programming to add a drop down menu of state for the city searched then pulled that data so we can use it to find events and parks. We are currently stuck on bringing the state, lat, and lon that we have put together on the front end to the back end. Once we have it on the backend, we can pull the lat and lon from the selected location to search events. We can also use the state, convert it to state initials and use our NPS API to return national parks in that state.

Felt like a good day.

## 6/10/22

Today we pair programmed and made some progress. We are now able to see our events and parks based on the lat lon and state. We now need to put that info on to cads so that we can show everything to the user. We didn't have much time today but still a successful day.

## 6/15/22

Today I learned about Local Storage and how we can use that to hold our data. It will let us keep data on the page even after a refresh. Now we don't have to worry about our data disappearing every time we make a small change in the code. We got help from Mitch on how to implement our data so it shows up in an array instead of object, object.

## 6/16/22

I was unable to help my group much today as I spent a majority of the day in the hospital. Hoping I feel better and can make some progress with my team tomorrow.

## 6/17/22

I was able to participate in some of the pair programming today but sadly I am not feeling much better. With a long weekend I hope to be fully recovered by Tuesday. Looking forward to making some progress on the home stretch of our project.

## 6/21/22

I am back! Feeling about 80% which is enough for me to help again. We have been able to get our weather data to show up and now Shane and I are going to work on formatting that data so that it shows up prettier.
