Today, I worked on:

*searched for apis that we can use to pull events from.

Our team broke up into individuals and each looked for apis that we could use. We originally tried EventBrite and others but they pulled down the api we needed. Contacted AllEvents to request their api as a substitute. Looked into Google Events Results API.

I found a National Parks API that can do everything we need for our parks section. We worked together to break down different queries to find out what we could do to change our search preferences.

Today, I worked on:

Building a couple models in the parks_rest directory and used the National Parks API in Insomnia to find the different information I can pull.

Found it pretty easy to navigate the information listed by the National Parks.

Today did not go well.

We spent a lot of time as a group trying to get through git issues. I managed to put together basics for a main page in our app page. Most of the day was spent trying to get through blockers around git.
