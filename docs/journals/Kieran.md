# Journal of the Journey

<p>Today I spent a lot of time searching for API's to use for our application.
I went through at least 10 Event based API's that were shut down, out of date, or locked behind a paywall. As negativity and hopelessness for our project began to creep in, we were saved. One more website we came across had the information we needed. We now have our Event based API. I tested some requests in insomnia to see if it gave the response we wanted, it all checks out. I also added this journals directory, sent an email to a Hiking trail api, and worked toward our Issues board. </p>

<p> I was wanted to get something done today so I decided to set up our application with the directories we will be working in. I created the Parks and Events django projects and apps. I also installed each app inside the projects settings.py. I added both the requirements.txt and Dockerfiles to each respective project. I began framing the Docker-compose yml file but there is still much more I need to learn about it. I think tomorrow I will finish that up and ask any lingering questions. I know we will continue to add to the compose file, but for now we have the basics.
